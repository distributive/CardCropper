# Card Cropper

This is a Python script for cropping full-bleed Netrunner card images and adding rounded corners. It currently supports NRDB, JNet, and creator resource portal sizes, but can be easily extended as required.

## Usage

Add the full-bleed image files to `source`, ensuring that they are named appropriately (the output filenames will copy the source filenames).

Run the script: `python3 main.py`

Move the generated files from each of the output directories in `out`.
